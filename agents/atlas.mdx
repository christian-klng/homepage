# About Atlas

Atlas is designed to be the backbone of your data infrastructure. Unlike traditional ETL tools, Atlas uses semantic understanding to link disparate data sources.

## Core Competencies

*   **Schema Inference**: Automatically detects relationships between tables.
*   **Query Optimization**: Rewrites SQL queries for 10x performance improvements.
*   **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time monitoring of data quality streams.

## Integration Guide

To integrate Atlas into your pipeline, simply provide read-access credentials. Atlas operates in a read-only mode by default to ensure data integrity.

```typescript
const atlas = new Agent('atlas-core');
await atlas.connect({ source: 'snowflake' });
```

## Use Cases

- **Financial Analytics**: Process millions of transactions to identify spending patterns
- **Healthcare Data**: Normalize patient records across multiple EMR systems
- **E-commerce**: Real-time inventory tracking and demand forecasting
