# Vesper Security Protocols

Vesper runs silently in the background of your infrastructure, analyzing traffic patterns for malicious intent.

## Detection Engine

Vesper uses a proprietary behavioral model to identify zero-day threats that signature-based antivirus software misses.

### Threat Categories

- **Network Intrusion**: Detects port scanning, DDoS attempts, and lateral movement
- **Data Exfiltration**: Monitors unusual data transfer patterns
- **Credential Stuffing**: Identifies brute force and credential spraying attacks
- **Insider Threats**: Behavioral analysis of user activity anomalies

## Incident Response

In the event of a breach, Vesper can:

1.  Isolate compromised nodes.
2.  Revoke API keys.
3.  Generate a forensic report for your security team.

## Compliance Dashboard

Vesper provides real-time compliance monitoring for:
- **GDPR** - Data residency and access controls
- **HIPAA** - PHI protection verification
- **PCI-DSS** - Payment data security
- **SOC2** - Trust services criteria

## Deployment Options

```typescript
const vesper = new Agent('vesper-sentinel');

await vesper.deploy({
  mode: 'passive', // or 'active' for auto-remediation
  scope: ['network', 'endpoints', 'cloud'],
  alertChannels: ['slack', 'pagerduty', 'email']
});
```

## Alert Configuration

Configure severity thresholds and escalation paths to match your security operations workflow.
